## Overview of the Project
### Project: Hospital Management System

This project is a **Hospital Management System** developed in Java. It is a console-based application designed to streamline the management of a healthcare facility. The system provides functionalities for registering patients, scheduling appointments, managing electronic health records (EHR), generating bills, tracking inventory, and adding staff details. With an intuitive menu-driven interface, this application simplifies various administrative tasks in hospitals.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive Hospital Management System that facilitates efficient handling of patient data, appointments, billing, and other hospital-related operations. The project emphasizes modular design and functionality while leveraging Java's object-oriented programming features to build a robust and scalable application.
